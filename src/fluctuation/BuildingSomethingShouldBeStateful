Building Something Should Be Stateful

Stateless objects are easy to handle. You can copy them, call any methods in
random way, and still you can expect a certain result.
You might want objects to be stateless. If they are stateless, you are freed
from consideration about consistency when you want to concentrate in calculation
itself.
In many cases, objects are stateful while they are being built.
Those states which occur during building process can be put into its builder and
isolated from the resulting objects which will be stateless.
